## Arrays

The type `numpy.ndarray` works differently to its closest Python-builtin equivalent (lists), in that it is invalid to add an integer to a list, whereas an ndarray will take the integer and add it *to every element* in the array.  Ndarrays do a lot of things element-wise, as it is specifically designed to do multi-dimensional operations, and so is more matrix-y by design.
